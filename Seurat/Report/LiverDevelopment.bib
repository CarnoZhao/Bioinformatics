The liver is a central regulator of metabolism, and liver failure thus constitutes a major health burden. Understanding how this complex organ develops during embryogenesis will yield insights into how liver regeneration can be promoted and how functional liver replacement tissue can be engineered. Recent studies of animal models have identified key signaling pathways and complex tissue interactions that progressively generate liver progenitor cells, differentiated lineages and functional tissues. In addition, progress in understanding how these cells interact, and how transcriptional and signaling programs precisely coordinate liver development, has begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this complexity. Here, we review the lineage relationships, signaling pathways and transcriptional programs that orchestrate hepatogenesis.},

	abstract = {Although adult mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been purified to near homogeneity, it remains impossible to achieve this with fetal HSCs. Adult HSC purity recently has been enhanced using the SLAM family receptors CD150, CD244, and CD48. These markers are expressed at different stages of the hematopoiesis hierarchy, making it possible to highly purify adult HSCs as CD150+CD48–CD244– cells. We found that SLAM family receptors exhibited a similar expression pattern in fetal liver. Fetal liver HSCs were CD150+CD48–CD244–, and the vast majority of colony-forming progenitors were CD48+CD244–CD150– or CD48+CD244+CD150–, just as in adult bone marrow. SLAM family markers enhanced the purification of fetal liver HSCs. Whereas 1 (11\%) of every 8.9 ThylowSca-1+lineage–Mac-1+ fetal liver cells gave long-term multilineage reconstitution in irradiated mice, 1 (18\%) of every 5.7 CD150+CD48–CD41– cells and 1 (37\%) of every 2.7 CD150+CD48–Sca-1+lineage–Mac-1+ fetal liver cells gave long-term multilineage reconstitution. These data emphasize the robustness with which SLAM family markers distinguish progenitors at different stages of the hematopoiesis hierarchy and enhance the purification of definitive HSCs from diverse contexts. Nonetheless, CD150, CD244, and CD48 are not pan-stem cell markers, as they were not detectably expressed by stem cells in the fetal or adult nervous system.},

This essay highlights concepts that have emerged from studies of the discrete steps of foregut endoderm development into the liver bud, as well as from modeling the steps via embryonic stem cell differentiation. Such concepts include understanding the chromatin basis for the competence of progenitor cells to develop into specific lineages; the importance of combinatorial signaling from different sources to induce cell fates; the impact of inductive signaling on preexisting chromatin states; the ability of separately specified domains of cells to merge into a common tissue; and the marked cell biological dynamics, including interactions with the developing vasculature, which establish the initial morphogenesis and patterning of a tissue. The principles gleaned from these studies, focusing on the 2 days it takes for the endoderm to develop into a liver bud, should be instructive for many other organogenic systems and for manipulating tissues in regenerative contexts for biomedical purposes.},

This powerful function of FL largely benefits from the niche (or microenvironment), which provides a residence for HSC expansion. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the FL niche consists of heterogeneous cell populations that associate with HSCs spatially and regulate HSCs functionally. At the molecular level, a complex of cell extrinsic and intrinsic signaling network within the FL niche cells maintains HSC expansion. Here, we summarize recent studies on the analysis of the FL HSCs and their niche, and specifically on the molecular regulatory network for HSC expansion. Based on these studies, we hypothesize a strategy to obtain a large number of functional HSCs via 3D reconstruction of FL organoid ex vivo for clinical treatment in the future.},

Here, we developed Microwell-seq, a high-throughput and low-cost scRNA-seq platform using simple, inexpensive devices. Using Microwell-seq, we analyzed more than 400,000 single cells covering all of the major mouse organs and constructed a basic scheme for a mouse cell atlas (MCA). We reveal a single-cell hierarchy for many tissues that have not been well characterized previously. We built a web-based “single-cell MCA analysis” pipeline that accurately defines cell types based on single-cell digital expression. Our study demonstrates the wide applicability of the Microwell-seq technology and MCA resource.},

BackgroundBecause of their differentiation potential, pluripotent stem cells can generate virtually any cell type and, as such, can be used to model development and disease and even hold the promise of providing cell-replacement therapies. Recently, structures resembling whole organs, termed organoids, have been generated from stem cells through the development of three-dimensional culture systems.Organoids are derived from pluripotent stem cells or isolated organ progenitors that differentiate to form an organlike tissue exhibiting multiple cell types that self-organize to form a structure not unlike the organ in vivo. This technology builds upon a foundation of stem cell technologies, as well as classical developmental biology and cell-mixing experiments. These studies illustrated two key events in structural organization during organogenesis: cell sorting out and spatially restricted lineage commitment. Both of these processes are recapitulated in organoids, which self-assemble to form the cellular organization of the organ itself.

Organoids can be derived for a number of organs from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Like organogenesis in vivo, organoids self-organize through both cell sorting out and spatially restricted lineage commitment of precursor cells. Organoids can be used to model disease by introducing disease mutations or using patient-derived PSCs. Future applications could include drug testing and even tissue replacement therapy.
AdvancesOrganoids have been generated for a number of organs from both mouse and human stem cells. To date, human pluripotent stem cells have been coaxed to generate intestinal, kidney, brain, and retinal organoids, as well as liver organoid-like tissues called liver buds. Derivation methods are specific to each of these systems, with a focus on recapitulation of endogenous developmental processes. Specifically, the methods so far developed use growth factors or nutrient combinations to drive the acquisition of organ precursor tissue identity. Then, a permissive three-dimensional culture environment is applied, often involving the use of extracellular matrix gels such as Matrigel. This allows the tissue to self-organize through cell sorting out and stem cell lineage commitment in a spatially defined manner to recapitulate organization of different organ cell types.These complex structures provide a unique opportunity to model human organ development in a system remarkably similar to development in vivo. Although the full extent of similarity in many cases still remains to be determined, organoids are already being applied to human-specific biological questions. Indeed, brain and retinal organoids have both been shown to exhibit properties that recapitulate human organ development and that cannot be observed in animal models. Naturally, limitations exist, such as the lack of blood supply, but future endeavors will advance the technology and, it is hoped, fully overcome these technical hurdles.
OutlookThe therapeutic promise of organoids is perhaps the area with greatest potential. These unique tissues have the potential to model developmental disease, degenerative conditions, and cancer. Genetic disorders can be modeled by making use of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells or by introducing disease mutations. Indeed, this type of approach has already been taken to generate organoids from patient stem cells for intestine, kidney, and brain.Furthermore, organoids that model disease can be used as an alternative system for drug testing that may not only better recapitulate effects in human patients but could also cut down on animal studies. Liver organoids, in particular, represent a system with high expectations, particularly for drug testing, because of the unique metabolic profile of the human liver. Finally, tissues derived in vitro could be generated from patient cells to provide alternative organ replacement strategies. Unlike current organ transplant treatments, such autologous tissues would not suffer from issues of immunocompetency and rejection.
The making of bodies part by part
Mention of organoids—organlike structure growing in a Petri dish—might conjure up images of science fiction. However, the generation of organoids is very real, as is the increased understanding of organ form and function that comes from studying them. Lancaster and Knoblich review organoids as structures that include more than one cell type of an organ that exhibit structural and functional features of the natural counterpart. Knowledge of normal organ developmental pathways guides the formation of these structures. Organoids show great promise for modeling human development and disease and for biomedical research and regenerative medicine.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1247125
Classical experiments performed half a century ago demonstrated the immense self-organizing capacity of vertebrate cells. Even after complete dissociation, cells can reaggregate and reconstruct the original architecture of an organ. More recently, this outstanding feature was used to rebuild organ parts or even complete organs from tissue or embryonic stem cells. Such stem cell–derived three-dimensional cultures are called organoids. Because organoids can be grown from human stem cells and from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, they have the potential to model human development and disease. Furthermore, they have potential for drug testing and even future organ replacement strategies. Here, we summarize this rapidly evolving field and outline the potential of organoid technology for future biomedical research.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review
The erythroid progenitors BFU-E (burst-forming unit-erythroid) and CFU-E (colony-forming unit-erythroid) have a critical role in erythropoiesis. They represent a heterogeneous and poorly characterized population of cells with modifiable self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation capabilities. This review focuses on the current state of erythroid progenitor biology with regard to immunophenotypic identification and regulatory programs; in addition, we will discuss the therapeutic implications of using these erythroid progenitors as pharmacologic targets.

Recent findings
Erythroid progenitors are classically defined by the appearance of morphologically defined colonies in semisolid cultures. However, these prior systems preclude a more thorough understanding of the composite nature of progenitor populations. Recent studies employing novel flow cytometric and cell-based assays have helped to redefine hematopoiesis, and suggest that erythroid progenitors may arise from different levels of the hematopoietic tree. Moreover, the identification of cell surface marker patterns in human BFU-E and CFU-E enhance our ability to perform downstream functional and molecular analyses at the population and single cell level. Advances in these techniques have already revealed novel subpopulations with increased self-renewing capacity, roles for erythroid progenitors in globin gene expression, and insights into pharmacologic mechanisms of glucocorticoids and pomalidomide.

Summary
Immunophenotypic and molecular characterization resolves the diversity of erythroid progenitors and may ultimately lead to the ability to target these progenitors to ameliorate diseases of dyserythropoiesis.},

	abstract = {The paradigm that all blood cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has been challenged by two findings. First, there are tissue-resident hematopoietic cells, including subsets of macrophages that are not replenished by adult HSCs, but instead are maintained by self-renewal of fetal-derived cells. Second, during embryogenesis, there is a conserved program of HSC-independent hematopoiesis that precedes HSC function and is required for embryonic survival. The presence of waves of HSC-independent hematopoiesis as well as fetal HSCs raises questions about the origin of fetal-derived adult tissue-resident macrophages. In the murine embryo, historical examination of embryonic macrophage and monocyte populations combined with recent reports utilizing genetic lineage-tracing approaches has led to a model of macrophage ontogeny that can be integrated with existing models of hematopoietic ontogeny. The first wave of hematopoiesis contains primitive erythroid, megakaryocyte and macrophage progenitors that arise in the yolk sac, and these macrophage progenitors are the source of early macrophages throughout the embryo, including the liver. A second wave of multipotential erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) also arises in the yolk sac . EMPs colonize the fetal liver, initiating myelopoiesis and forming macrophages. Lineage tracing indicates that this second wave of macrophages are distributed in most fetal tissues, although not appreciably in the brain. Thus, fetal-derived adult tissue-resident macrophages, other than microglia, appear to predominately derive from EMPs. While HSCs emerge at midgestation and colonize the fetal liver, the relative contribution of fetal HSCs to tissue macrophages at later stages of development is unclear. The inclusion of macrophage potential in multiple waves of hematopoiesis is consistent with reports of their functional roles throughout development in innate immunity, phagocytosis, and tissue morphogenesis and remodeling. Understanding the influences of developmental origin, as well as local tissue-specific signals, will be necessary to fully decode the diverse functions and responses of tissue-resident macrophages.,},
